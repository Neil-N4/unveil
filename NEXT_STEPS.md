# âœ… Supabase Integration Complete!

## ðŸŽ‰ What's Done

1. âœ… All code files created
2. âœ… Dependencies installed (Python & Next.js)
3. âœ… Supabase credentials added to `.env`
4. âœ… Environment configured

## ðŸ“‹ Final Steps

### 1. Run Database Setup SQL

Go to your Supabase dashboard:
- URL: https://scgcjpnusthzlhkyuomr.supabase.co
- Go to **SQL Editor** â†’ **New Query**
- Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase_setup.sql`
- Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
- You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### 2. Start Both Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Flow

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/sign-in
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. You'll be redirected to `/onboarding`
5. Fill out the hair preferences survey
6. You'll land on `/discover` page
7. Click "Ping backend (JWT)" to test backend authentication

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you get "Missing token" error:
- Make sure both servers are running
- Check that `.env` has the correct Supabase credentials
- Restart both servers after any `.env` changes

### If you can't sign in with Google:
- Go to Supabase â†’ Authentication â†’ Providers
- Enable Google provider
- Add `http://localhost:3000` to allowed redirect URLs

### If SQL setup fails:
- Make sure you're running it in the SQL Editor
- Copy the entire `supabase_setup.sql` file contents
- Run it all at once (not line by line)

## ðŸ“Š Database Tables Created

- `profiles` - User profile information
- `beauty_preferences` - User hair preferences and survey data
- Row-level security enabled (users can only see their own data)

## ðŸš€ You're Ready!

Everything is configured. Just run the SQL setup and start testing!
